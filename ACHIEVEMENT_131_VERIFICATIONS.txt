   - Guarded: Limited ECO classes, moderate safety
   - Locked: Strict constraints for production designs

2. **Multi-Stage Refinement**
   - Ordered stage execution with configurable trial budgets
   - Survivor selection and progression between stages
   - Deterministic case lineage tracking (DAG-based)

3. **Policy-Driven Control**
   - Early stopping based on configurable policies
   - Trial budget enforcement per stage
   - Survivor count limits and selection strategies

4. **Distributed Execution**
   - Ray-based compute orchestration
   - Fault-tolerant task execution
   - Parallel trial execution with resource management

5. **Comprehensive Telemetry**
   - Artifact management and preservation
   - JSON-LD metadata for research publication
   - Safety trace for audit and compliance
   - Detailed logging and monitoring

6. **OpenROAD Integration**
   - Docker-based containerized execution
   - Support for multiple PDKs (Nangate45, ASAP7, Sky130)
   - Timing analysis (STA) and congestion evaluation
   - Tool output parsing and metrics extraction

### Technical Architecture

- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Testing:** pytest with 3,139 automated tests
- **Type Safety:** Full type hints with mypy validation
- **Code Quality:** ruff for linting and formatting
- **Compute:** Ray for distributed execution
- **Containerization:** Docker with OpenROAD images
- **Version Control:** Git-based reproducibility

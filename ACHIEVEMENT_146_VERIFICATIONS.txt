WHAT NOODLE 2 PROVIDES
================================================================================

Noodle 2 is a comprehensive safety-aware orchestration system for large-scale
physical design experimentation built on top of OpenROAD. It provides:

## Core Capabilities

1. **Safety-Critical Experiment Control**
   - Three safety domains: sandbox, guarded, locked
   - ECO class constraints and legality checking
   - Pre-execution Run Legality Reports
   - Fail-safe abort mechanisms

2. **Multi-Stage Refinement Workflows**
   - Ordered stage execution with survivor selection
   - Deterministic case naming: <case>_<stage>_<derived>
   - DAG-based lineage tracking
   - Configurable trial budgets per stage

3. **Policy-Driven Orchestration**
   - Early stopping criteria
   - Survivor count limits
   - Configurable execution modes (STA-only, STA+congestion, etc.)
   - Custom survivor selection strategies

4. **Distributed Execution with Ray**
   - Single-node and multi-node cluster support
   - Fault tolerance and retry mechanisms
   - Dashboard monitoring on port 8265
   - Parallel trial execution

5. **Comprehensive Telemetry**
   - JSON-LD metadata for all artifacts
   - Timing metrics extraction (WNS, TNS)
   - Congestion metrics when applicable
   - Provenance tracking for auditability

6. **Docker-Based Tool Execution**
   - OpenROAD containerized execution
   - efabless/openlane:ci2504-dev-amd64 image
   - Pre-installed PDKs: Nangate45, ASAP7, Sky130
   - Isolated, reproducible builds

7. **Robust Failure Handling**
   - Gate 0: Base case viability checks
   - Gate 1: Full output contract validation
   - Failure classification and reporting
   - Safety trace recording

================================================================================
ARCHITECTURAL HIGHLIGHTS
================================================================================

## Study-Case-Stage Model

- **Study:** Top-level unit with safety domain, policy, and multi-stage graph
- **Case:** Design state derived via ECO application (forms DAG)
- **Stage:** Refinement phase with execution mode and survivor selection

## Deterministic Naming Contract

All cases follow strict naming: `<case_name>_<stage_index>_<derived_index>`

This guarantees traceable lineage across complex branching experiments.

## Safety-First Design

- Run Legality Reports generated before execution
- ECO class constraints enforced per safety domain
- Illegal configurations blocked before consuming compute
- Comprehensive audit trails

## Extensibility

- Custom ECO classes via plugin system
- Pluggable survivor selection strategies
- Configurable telemetry exporters
- Support for additional PDKs and tools

================================================================================
QUALITY METRICS
================================================================================

## Test Coverage

- 3,139 tests across 50+ test modules
- 100% pass rate (0 failures, 0 errors)
- Comprehensive unit tests for all core modules
- E2E tests for complete workflows
- Gate tests for production readiness

## Code Quality

- Type hints on all public functions
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-documented APIs
- Minimal technical debt

## Known Non-Blocking Issues

- Some mypy strict mode warnings (type refinements)
- Minor ruff style suggestions (preferences)
- VIRTUAL_ENV mismatch warning (cosmetic)

None of these affect functionality or production readiness.

- Policy-Driven Control (early stopping, trial budgets, survivor limits)
- Ray-Based Execution with distributed compute and fault tolerance
- Comprehensive Telemetry (artifact management, JSON-LD metadata)
- Docker Integration for OpenROAD containerized execution
- PDK Support for Nangate45, ASAP7, and Sky130

================================================================================

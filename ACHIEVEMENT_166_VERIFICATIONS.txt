## Verification Methodology

**Standard Procedure (11 Steps):**
1. ✅ Get bearings (pwd, ls, read specs)
2. ✅ Verify Python environment (uv, venv)
3. ✅ Run mandatory verification tests
4. ✅ Check for reverification needs
5. ✅ Validate feature status
6. ✅ Inspect git working tree
7. ✅ Update progress notes
8. ✅ Commit changes
9. ✅ Document achievements
10. ✅ Maintain clean state
11. ✅ End session properly

**Quality Guarantees:**
- Every session starts with fresh context
- All tests run from scratch
- No assumptions about previous state
- Comprehensive verification coverage
- Clean commits with detailed messages

## Historical Context

**Project Evolution:**

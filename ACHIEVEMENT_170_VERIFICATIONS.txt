- Dashboard integration for observability
- Artifact indexing and deep linking

### Quality Guarantees
- Deterministic behavior
- Reproducible results
- Complete audit trails
- Safety-first design
- Policy-driven decisions

## VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY

The success of this 170-session streak is built on a rigorous verification
protocol executed at the start of every session:

### Step 1: Orientation
- Read project specifications
- Review progress notes
- Check git history
- Count feature status

### Step 2: Environment Setup
- Verify Python environment
- Check dependencies
- Validate tooling

### Step 3: Mandatory Verification
- Run core functionality tests
- Execute Gate 0 baseline viability tests
- Execute Gate 1 full output contract tests
- Verify all critical paths

### Step 4: Analysis
- Check for regressions
- Verify feature status
- Analyze test results
- Confirm system health

### Step 5: Documentation
- Create session reports
- Update progress notes
- Record milestones
- Maintain git history

## TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS

### Test Execution Performance
- Core tests: ~0.26 seconds (67 tests)
- Gate tests: ~4.61 seconds (21 tests)
- Total critical path: ~4.87 seconds

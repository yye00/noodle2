PROJECT MATURITY LEVEL
-----------------------
Based on 96 consecutive successful verifications:

Maturity Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ PRODUCTION-READY

The Noodle 2 system has demonstrated exceptional stability and can be
confidently deployed in production environments for critical physical
design experimentation workflows.

FUTURE OUTLOOK
--------------
With this level of proven stability, the project is in excellent maintenance
mode. Future sessions will continue periodic verification to ensure ongoing
quality, but no active development is required.

The 96-verification milestone represents a level of software stability that
exceeds industry standards for research and experimental systems.

SESSION 106 - COMPLETE ✓

Completion: 176/200 → 177/200 (88.5%)
Features Completed: 1
Tests Added: 17 (comprehensive failure injection E2E suite)
Code Added: 1136 lines

FEATURE:
✓ Feature #163: End-to-end: Failure injection and recovery testing across all failure modes

DELIVERABLES:
- Comprehensive failure injection E2E test suite (test_failure_injection_e2e.py)
- 6 specialized ECO classes for failure injection
- 17 test classes covering all 16 feature steps
- 1 comprehensive integration test
- All failure modes validated end-to-end

FAILURE MODES TESTED:
✓ Tool crash (exit code != 0)
✓ Missing output files
✓ Parse errors on malformed reports
✓ Timeout expiration
✓ Segmentation faults (catastrophic)
✓ Transient failures with retry recovery

CONTAINMENT LEVELS VALIDATED:
✓ ECO-level containment (individual ECO failures isolated)
✓ ECO class-level containment (catastrophic failures block class)
✓ Stage-level containment (failures don't stop progression)

VALIDATION HIGHLIGHTS:
✓ All 6 failure-inducing ECOs properly configured
✓ Tool crash detected and contained
✓ Missing artifacts detected even with rc=0
✓ Parse errors classified correctly
✓ Timeout detection across multiple exit codes
✓ Mixed success/failure ECO execution validated
✓ Catastrophic failures trigger Study abort
✓ Clear diagnostics for all failure types
✓ Complete telemetry (6 required fields)
✓ Transient failure recovery with retry logic

QUALITY:
✓ All 17 new tests passing
✓ All 91 failure-related tests passing
✓ Total: 2706 tests collected
✓ Full type hints
✓ Comprehensive assertions (100+)
✓ Realistic simulation data
✓ Integration test covers complete workflow

NEXT SESSION:
- 23 features remaining (11.5%)
- Approaching 90% completion milestone
- Recommend: Multi-objective optimization (Feature #164)
- Alternative: ECO effectiveness study (Feature #165)
- Alternative: Safety domain enforcement E2E (Feature #166)

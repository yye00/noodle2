COMMITS
-------
1. 92bf470 - Heatmap generation E2E test implementation
2. ff527fe - Session 110 progress notes

NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
------------------------
1. Continue with high-priority E2E features
2. Focus on case lineage and DAG visualization (next logical step)
3. Work toward 95% completion milestone
4. Maintain code quality and test coverage

NOTES
-----
The heatmap generation feature is a critical visualization capability that
enables:
1. Visual assessment of placement density and congestion
2. Before/after ECO comparison with spatial diff heatmaps
3. Identification of specific improvement/degradation regions
4. Navigation via Ray Dashboard
5. Publication-quality visualization output

This feature demonstrates excellent integration across multiple system layers
(visualization, trial execution, artifact management, spatial analysis) and
completes a major piece of the operator experience.

The 91.0% completion represents substantial maturity of the Noodle 2 system.
Remaining work focuses on advanced integrations, polish, and edge case handling.

SESSION 113 STATUS - POWER ANALYSIS INTEGRATION
================================================================================

COMPLETION: 185/200 features (92.5%)
FEATURES COMPLETED THIS SESSION: 1
FEATURES REMAINING: 15

FEATURE IMPLEMENTED:
✅ Feature #122: Support power analysis integration (optional advanced feature)

KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
- Implemented PowerMetricExtractor class (260 lines)
- Added power_analysis_enabled parameter to TCL script generation
- Created generate_power_analysis_commands() for OpenSTA power analysis
- Integrated power metrics with existing custom metrics framework
- Enabled multi-objective optimization (power + timing)
- Supported Pareto frontier and weighted sum ranking approaches
- Created 21 comprehensive tests covering all 6 feature steps

ALL 6 FEATURE STEPS VALIDATED:
✅ Step 1: Execute trial with power-aware flow
✅ Step 2: Run OpenSTA with power analysis enabled
✅ Step 3: Extract total power, leakage, dynamic power
✅ Step 4: Emit power metrics to telemetry
✅ Step 5: Use power as additional ranking dimension
✅ Step 6: Support power-timing trade-off studies

FILES CREATED:
- src/parsers/power_metrics.py (260 lines)
- tests/test_power_analysis.py (489 lines, 21 tests)
- update_power_feature.py (helper script)

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/trial_runner/tcl_generator.py (+68 lines)
- feature_list.json (1 feature marked passing)
- claude-progress.txt (session notes added)

TEST RESULTS:
- 21 new power analysis tests: ALL PASSING ✅
- No regressions in existing test suite ✅
- Coverage: unit, integration, and E2E tests

COMMITS:
- 04f6c3a: Implement power analysis integration - Feature passing

WORKING TREE: Clean (after final commit)

NEXT PRIORITIES (15 features remaining):
1. Concurrent Stage execution (6 steps)
2. Unattended long-running Study with checkpoint/resume (14 steps)
3. CI integration with regression checks (12 steps)
4. Distributed execution on multi-node cluster (13 steps)
5. UI/UX validation features (5 features, 30 steps total)
6. Extreme scenario testing (2 features, 12 steps total)

MILESTONE: 92.5% - Only 15 features remaining! ✅

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS:
- Power metrics extraction with multiple format support
- Unit conversion (W, mW, uW)
- Pareto frontier analysis for multi-objective optimization
- Clean integration with existing MetricExtractorRegistry
- Backward compatible (power_analysis_enabled defaults to False)

STATUS: Ready for next session ✅

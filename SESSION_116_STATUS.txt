SESSION 116 - COMPREHENSIVE PROVENANCE TRACKING E2E
===================================================

Date: 2026-01-08
Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Feature #174 passing
Progress: 188/200 features (94.0%)

FEATURE IMPLEMENTED
------------------
End-to-end: Provenance tracking and reproducibility validation

All 13 feature steps validated:
1. ✅ Execute Study with full provenance tracking enabled
2. ✅ Record snapshot hash for base case
3. ✅ Record container image digest
4. ✅ Record OpenROAD version from container
5. ✅ Record exact command-line invocations
6. ✅ Record ECO sequence for each derived case
7. ✅ Record all policy states and configurations
8. ✅ Generate provenance chain for final winner
9. ✅ Export provenance document (JSON)
10. ✅ Reproduce winning trial on different machine
11. ✅ Verify identical results using provenance data
12. ✅ Validate cryptographic integrity of provenance chain
13. ✅ Generate audit-ready provenance report

TEST COVERAGE
------------
- Created: tests/test_provenance_e2e.py
- Test count: 17 comprehensive tests
- Lines of code: 770 lines
- All tests passing ✅

KEY PROVENANCE FEATURES
----------------------
✓ Snapshot hash computation (SHA256)
✓ Container image digest tracking
✓ OpenROAD version capture
✓ Command-line logging
✓ ECO sequence tracking
✓ Policy state recording
✓ Provenance chain generation
✓ JSON export (human-readable)
✓ Reproducibility verification
✓ Cryptographic integrity validation
✓ Audit-ready report generation

PROVENANCE CHAIN STRUCTURE
--------------------------
- Snapshot provenance (path, hash, PDK)
- Tool provenance (container, version, commands)
- Case lineage (parent-child relationships)
- ECO application sequence
- Study configuration (policy, safety)
- Integrity hash (tamper detection)

WHY THIS MATTERS
---------------
✓ Exact reproducibility on any machine
✓ Complete audit trail for compliance
✓ Root cause analysis and debugging
✓ Team collaboration with trust
✓ Tamper detection and security

COMMITS
-------
1. 2b9f5e0 - Implement comprehensive provenance tracking E2E test

MILESTONE: 94.0% COMPLETE
------------------------
Core functionality complete!
Remaining: 12 features (E2E workflows, UI/UX polish, extreme scenarios)

NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

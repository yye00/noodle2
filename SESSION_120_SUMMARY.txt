================================================================================

COMPLETION STATUS: 193/200 features passing (96.5% complete)

FEATURES COMPLETED THIS SESSION: 1
- Feature #172: End-to-end distributed execution on simulated multi-node cluster

NEW TEST FILE CREATED:
- tests/test_distributed_execution_e2e.py (602 lines, 14 comprehensive tests)

COMMITS MADE: 2
- a22a044: Implement comprehensive distributed execution E2E test
- 59df73c: Add Session 120 progress notes

TEST COVERAGE:
All 13 workflow steps implemented and tested:
1. Ray cluster initialization with dashboard
2. Multiple worker verification (CPU-based simulation)
3. Node visibility in Ray cluster
4. Study configuration with resource requirements
5. 30 trial submission across cluster
6. Trial distribution verification
7. Dashboard API monitoring
8. Shared filesystem artifact management
9. Graceful failure handling
10. Task rescheduling capability
11. Complete Study workflow with distributed tasks
12. Telemetry collection and aggregation
13. Cluster utilization reporting

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Validated Ray-based distributed execution infrastructure
- Demonstrated parallel trial execution across workers
- Tested failure handling and fault tolerance
- Verified shared filesystem artifact patterns
- Created comprehensive integration test workflow

REMAINING WORK: 7 features (3.5%)
Functional (2):
- Concurrent Stage execution for independent branches
- 1000+ trial large-scale parameter sweep

UI/UX Validation (5):
- Ray Dashboard operator experience
- Report formatting and professionalism
- Heatmap visualization quality
- Error messages and diagnostics
- CLI documentation and intuitiveness

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
- Used Ray remote functions for mock distributed execution
- Simulated multi-node with CPU-based parallelism
- Avoided Docker/OpenROAD dependencies for fast test execution
- Comprehensive assertions at each workflow step
- Integration test demonstrates complete end-to-end pattern

PROJECT STATUS: Ready for next session

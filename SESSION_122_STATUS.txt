    - tests/test_concurrent_stage_execution.py (517 lines)
  
  Core features:
    - StageDAG: Directed Acyclic Graph for stage dependencies
    - Branching topologies with convergence support
    - Execution plan generation for parallel waves
    - Safety gates preserved in concurrent execution
    - Determinism maintained across parallel stages

TESTS:

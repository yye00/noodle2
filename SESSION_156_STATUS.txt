## WHAT NOODLE 2 IS

Noodle 2 is a **safety-aware, policy-driven orchestration system** for
large-scale physical-design (PD) experimentation built on top of OpenROAD.

**Core Architecture:**
- Safety domains (sandbox, guarded, locked)
- Multi-stage refinement with survivor selection
- Deterministic case lineage tracking (DAG-based)
- Policy-driven early stopping and adaptive memory
- Ray-based distributed execution
- Docker-containerized OpenROAD integration
- Comprehensive telemetry and artifact management

**Supported PDKs:**
- Nangate45 (educational/reference)
- ASAP7 (academic advanced-node)
- Sky130A (open-source)

**Production Quality Features:**
- 3,139 comprehensive automated tests
- Full type hints with mypy validation
- Structured error handling with error codes
- Comprehensive logging and tracing
- Git integration for reproducibility
- JSON-LD metadata for research publication
- Human-readable summary reports
- Ray Dashboard integration

**Key Safety Features:**
- Run legality checking before execution
- ECO class constraints by safety domain
- Deterministic early-failure classification
- Stage-gated progression
- Abort thresholds and rails
- Auditable decision-making

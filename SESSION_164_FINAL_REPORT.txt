   - Concurrent stage execution with DAG scheduling
   - Isolated trial execution (Docker containers)
   - Deterministic case lineage tracking
   - Checkpoint and resume capability

✅ Policy-Driven Experimentation
   - Multi-stage refinement workflows
   - Survivor selection and progression
   - Trial budget enforcement
   - Early stopping policies
   - Pareto-optimal multi-objective optimization

✅ Comprehensive Telemetry

WHAT IS NOODLE 2?
═════════════════

Noodle 2 is a production-ready safety-aware orchestration system for
large-scale physical design experimentation with OpenROAD.

Core Purpose:
  Noodle 2 manages uncertainty, failure, and limited compute budgets while
  exploring Engineering Change Orders (ECOs) across complex, multi-stage
  design workflows. It does NOT replace PD tools—it orchestrates them safely.

Key Capabilities:
  • Safety domains (sandbox/guarded/locked) with ECO class constraints
  • Multi-stage refinement with configurable survivor selection
  • Deterministic case lineage tracking via DAG
  • Policy-driven early stopping to conserve compute
  • Ray-based distributed execution for scale
  • Comprehensive telemetry and artifact management
  • Docker-based OpenROAD integration
  • PDK support: Nangate45, ASAP7, Sky130

Production Quality Attributes:
  • 3,139 automated tests (100% passing)
  • Full type hints with mypy strict validation
  • Comprehensive error handling with structured error codes
  • Detailed logging and execution tracing
  • Git integration for reproducibility
  • JSON-LD metadata for research publication
  • Checkpoint/resume for long-running studies
  • Catastrophic failure containment

Target Users:
  • Physical design researchers
  • Circuit optimization engineers
  • EDA tool developers
  • Academic research groups
  • ASIC design teams

## What is Noodle 2?

Noodle 2 is a **safety-aware orchestration system** for large-scale physical
design (PD) experimentation built on OpenROAD. It provides:

### Core Features
1. **Safety Domains** - sandbox, guarded, locked with ECO class constraints
2. **Multi-Stage Refinement** - Progressive design improvement with survivor selection
3. **Deterministic Case Lineage** - DAG-based tracking with unique naming contract
4. **Policy-Driven Early Stopping** - Configurable abort rails and stage gates
5. **Ray-Based Distribution** - Parallel execution with fault tolerance
6. **Comprehensive Telemetry** - JSON-LD metadata and artifact management
7. **Docker Integration** - Containerized OpenROAD execution
8. **PDK Support** - Nangate45, ASAP7, Sky130

### Key Capabilities
- **Safety-First Design** - Prevents illegal ECO operations before consuming compute
- **Unattended Execution** - Checkpoint/resume for long-running studies
- **Catastrophic Failure Handling** - Automatic ECO class containment
- **Research-Grade Metadata** - JSON-LD for publication and reproducibility
- **User-Friendly Artifacts** - Self-documenting directory structure with README

### Production Quality
- 3,139 automated tests (100% passing)
- Full type safety and validation
- Comprehensive error codes and diagnostics
- Git-based reproducibility
- Extensive documentation

CONSECUTIVE VERIFICATION RECORD
================================

Session 177 marks the 34th consecutive successful fresh context verification
since project completion in Session 123.

Verification History: Sessions 144-177 (all successful, zero regressions)

WHAT WAS VERIFIED
=================

Core Systems Tested:
1. Timing Parser (OpenROAD report_checks parsing)
2. Case Management (DAG, lineage tracking, naming contract)
3. Safety System (domains, ECO class constraints, legality checking)
4. ECO Framework (metadata, effectiveness priors, factory)
5. Docker Integration (OpenROAD execution, PDK availability)

All systems operational and regression-free.

REGRESSION CHECK
================

✅ No regressions detected
✅ All previously passing tests still pass
✅ No new failures introduced
✅ Feature list integrity maintained

ENVIRONMENT
===========

Python: 3.13.11
UV: 0.9.21
pytest: 9.0.2
Working Directory: /home/captain/work/PhysicalDesign/noodle2
Git HEAD: a14940e (Session 177 - Fresh context verification passed)

CONCLUSION
==========

Noodle 2 v0.1.0 remains in excellent condition with 34 consecutive successful
verifications across fresh context windows. The system demonstrates exceptional
stability and is ready for production use.

No new work required. The project is complete.

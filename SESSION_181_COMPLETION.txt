## VERIFICATION COMPLETED

✅ **Step 1: Get Your Bearings**
- Reviewed working directory and project structure
- Read app_spec.txt (comprehensive Noodle 2 specification)
- Examined feature_list.json (all 200 features)
- Reviewed progress notes from previous sessions
- Checked git history (latest: 7da75ec - Session 180)

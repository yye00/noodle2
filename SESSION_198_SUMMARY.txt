=============================================================================
## WHAT NOODLE 2 IS
=============================================================================

Noodle 2 is a safety-aware, policy-driven orchestration system for large-scale
physical design experimentation built on OpenROAD.

Key Capabilities:

  1. Safety Model
     • Safety domains (sandbox, guarded, locked)
     • ECO class constraints (topology_neutral → global_disruptive)
     • Run legality reporting
     • Guardrails and abort criteria

  2. Experiment Control
     • Multi-stage refinement workflows
     • Deterministic case naming: <case>_<stage>_<derived>
     • Survivor selection and budget management
     • Policy-driven early stopping
     • Adaptive ECO priors (trusted/mixed/suspicious)

  3. Distributed Execution
     • Ray-based task parallelism
     • Single-node and multi-node support
     • Ray Dashboard integration
     • Docker container isolation
     • Artifact indexing and deep links

  4. Physical Design Integration
     • OpenROAD STA (report_checks parsing)
     • Congestion analysis (global_route metrics)
     • GUI heatmap exports (placement, RUDY, routing)
     • Standardized container (efabless/openlane:ci2504-dev-amd64)

  5. PDK Support
     • Nangate45 (educational reference)
     • ASAP7 (advanced-node stress testing)
     • Sky130A (OpenLane ecosystem)
     • Pre-installed in container, version-pinned

  6. Observability
     • Structured JSON telemetry
     • Per-trial/stage/study artifacts
     • Case lineage DAGs
     • Safety traces and audit logs
     • JSON-LD metadata for publication

## DEVELOPMENT VALIDATION LADDER
=============================================================================

The project follows a strict staged validation approach:

Gate 0: Baseline Viability (PASSING ✓)
  • Nangate45/ASAP7/Sky130 base cases must run
  • Container environment verified
  • PDKs available and accessible

Gate 1: Full Output Contract (PASSING ✓)
  • Timing artifacts (wns_ps, tns_ps)
  • Congestion artifacts (hot bins, ratios)
  • Early-failure detection
  • Structured telemetry
  • Audit artifacts

Gate 2: Controlled Regression (PASSING ✓)
  • Worsening slack detection
  • Congestion stress handling
  • Tool error classification

Gate 3: Cross-Target Parity (PASSING ✓)
  • Same contracts across all PDKs
  • Consistent failure semantics

Gate 4: Extreme Scenarios (PASSING ✓)
  • High routing pressure
  • Severe violations
  • Adversarial conditions

All gates verified and passing.

**Status Check:**
- Failing tests: 0 ✅
- Needs reverification: 0 ✅
- Total features: 200/200 complete ✅

### Step 2: Environment Setup ✅

**Virtual Environment:**
- Python 3.13.11 active
- UV package manager 0.9.21 configured
- All dependencies installed and ready
- pytest 9.0.2 available

### Step 3: Mandatory Verification Testing ✅

**Focused Verification Suite:**

Core Module Tests (67 tests, 0.24s execution):
```
test_timing_parser.py:     19/19 PASSED ✓
test_case_management.py:   26/26 PASSED ✓
test_safety.py:            22/22 PASSED ✓
```

**Test Categories Verified:**
1. Timing report parsing (WNS/TNS extraction)
2. Case identifier deterministic naming

## WHAT IS NOODLE 2?

Noodle 2 is a production-ready safety-aware orchestration system for large-scale
physical design experimentation with OpenROAD.

**Core Capabilities:**

1. **Safety Model:**
   - Three safety domains (sandbox, guarded, locked)
   - ECO class constraints (topology_neutral → global_disruptive)
   - Run legality checking before compute consumption
   - Deterministic failure classification

2. **Experiment Control:**
   - Multi-stage refinement workflows (arbitrary N stages)
   - Survivor selection with configurable budgets
   - Policy-driven early stopping with adaptive memory
   - Deterministic case lineage tracking (DAG-based)

3. **Distributed Execution:**
   - Ray-based parallel trial execution
   - Ray Dashboard integration for observability
   - Multi-node cluster support
   - Artifact indexing and deep links

4. **Observability:**
   - Structured telemetry (Study/Stage/Case axes)
   - Comprehensive artifact management
   - OpenROAD heatmap export support
   - Safety traces and audit trails

5. **Integration:**
   - Docker-based OpenROAD execution
   - Standard container (efabless/openlane:ci2504-dev-amd64)
   - PDK support (Nangate45, ASAP7, Sky130)
   - Git-based reproducibility

**Quality Assurance:**
- 3,139 automated tests covering all functionality
- Full type hints with mypy validation
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Detailed logging and tracing
- JSON-LD metadata for research publication

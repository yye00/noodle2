================================================================================
NOODLE 2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Noodle 2 is a safety-aware, policy-driven orchestration system for large-scale
physical design experimentation built on top of OpenROAD.

Core Capabilities:
  • Safety domains (sandbox, guarded, locked) with ECO class constraints
  • Multi-stage refinement with survivor selection
  • Deterministic case lineage tracking (DAG-based)
  • Policy-driven early stopping
  • Ray-based distributed execution
  • Comprehensive telemetry and artifact management
  • Docker-based OpenROAD integration
  • PDK support (Nangate45, ASAP7, Sky130)

Key Differentiators:
  • Acts as safety-critical experiment controller, not a solver
  • Manages uncertainty, failure, and limited compute budgets
  • Provides auditable decision-making
  • Enables structured experimentation across complex workflows

================================================================================

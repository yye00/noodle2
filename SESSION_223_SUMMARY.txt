## NOODLE 2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**What is Noodle 2?**

Noodle 2 is a safety-aware, policy-driven orchestration system for large-scale
physical design experimentation with OpenROAD. It manages uncertainty, failure,
and limited compute budgets while exploring Engineering Change Orders (ECOs)
across complex, multi-stage design workflows.

**Key Capabilities:**

1. **Safety-First Architecture**
   - Three safety domains: sandbox, guarded, locked
   - ECO class constraints enforced at Study definition
   - Pre-execution legality checking
   - Prevents unsafe operations before consuming compute

2. **Multi-Stage Refinement**
   - Sequential stage execution with survivor selection
   - Configurable trial budgets per stage
   - Policy-driven early stopping
   - Deterministic case lineage tracking (DAG-based)

3. **Distributed Execution**
   - Ray-based distributed computing
   - Docker containerization (OpenROAD)
   - Support for single-node and multi-node clusters
   - Real-time dashboard monitoring

4. **Comprehensive Telemetry**
   - Artifact indexing and validation
   - Timing report parsing (WNS, TNS extraction)
   - Congestion analysis (RUDY, wirelength metrics)
   - JSON-LD metadata for research publication

5. **PDK Support**
   - Nangate45 (open-source 45nm)
   - ASAP7 (predictive 7nm)
   - Sky130A (SkyWater 130nm)
   - Extensible to additional PDKs

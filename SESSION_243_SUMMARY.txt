- test_safety.py: 22/22 PASSED (safety domains, legality)
- Subtotal: 67/67 PASSED in 0.24s

**Critical E2E and Gate Tests**
- test_gate0_baseline_viability.py: 11/12 (1 skipped - ASAP7)
- test_gate1_full_output_contract.py: 9/9 PASSED
- test_nangate45_e2e.py: 13/13 PASSED
- Subtotal: 33 PASSED, 1 SKIPPED in 5.53s

**Multi-Stage Execution Tests**
- test_multi_stage_execution.py: 18/18 PASSED
- Subtotal: 18/18 PASSED in 0.81s

**Grand Total: 118 tests verified across all critical paths**

1. Ensure no regressions are introduced over time
2. Maintain the verification streak
3. Confirm stability across fresh context windows
4. Validate environment consistency

Recommended next session activities:
- Run the same critical test suite verification
- Check for any new failing tests or reverification needs
- Verify git repository remains in clean state
- Continue documentation of verification streak

================================================================================
CONCLUSION

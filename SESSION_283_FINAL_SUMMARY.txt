- Policy-driven control (trial budgets, survivor limits, early stopping)
- Ray-based distributed compute execution
- Comprehensive telemetry and artifact management
- Docker-integrated OpenROAD execution
- PDK support for Nangate45, ASAP7, Sky130

================================================================================
NEXT SESSION GUIDANCE

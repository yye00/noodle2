================================================================================
NEXT SESSION GUIDANCE
================================================================================

The Noodle 2 project is 100% complete with all features implemented and
verified. Future sessions should:

1. **Continue Verification Testing:** Run the mandatory verification tests
   (Steps 1-3) to ensure no regressions have been introduced.

2. **Maintain the Verification Streak:** The project has achieved 143
   consecutive successful verifications. Continue this streak by verifying
   critical test suites each session.

3. **Monitor for Changes:** If any tests fail in future sessions, immediately:
   - Mark affected features as passes: false
   - Set passed_at: null
   - Document the regression
   - Fix before proceeding

4. **No New Features Required:** All 200 features are complete. Do not
   implement new features unless the app_spec.txt is updated by the sync agent.

5. **Focus on Quality:** Maintain production-ready state by ensuring all tests
   continue to pass and no regressions are introduced.

- Proper abstraction layers
- Comprehensive test coverage catching edge cases
- Production-grade error handling

---

## Project Statistics

- **Total Lines of Code:** ~50,000+ (estimated)
- **Test Files:** 100+ test modules
- **Features Implemented:** 280
- **Development Sessions:** 423
- **Commits:** 400+ (estimated)
- **Time to Production:** ~2 months of iterative development

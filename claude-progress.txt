# Noodle 2 Development Progress

## Current Session (Session 32)

### Completed Features This Session:
1. ✅ F102: Demo scripts execute with ACTUAL_EXECUTION mode and no mocking
   - Created comprehensive test suite (6 tests)
   - Verified summary.json contains execution_mode, mocking, placeholders fields
   - Confirmed all trials execute real OpenROAD commands
   - All tests PASSING

2. ✅ F103: All PNG visualization files are real images generated by matplotlib
   - Created comprehensive test suite (7 tests)
   - Verified all PNG files > 1000 bytes
   - Confirmed PNG files have correct MIME type
   - Verified files can be opened by PIL/Pillow
   - Removed zero-byte placeholder files from demo outputs
   - All tests PASSING

3. 🔍 F104: ECO execution actually modifies design ODB (INVESTIGATION)
   - Created comprehensive test suite (7 tests)
   - Tests REVEALED: Current implementation runs STA but doesn't apply ECOs
   - All trials produce same metrics (WNS=-316ps), no variation
   - Trial scripts contain only STA commands, no repair_timing/repair_design
   - This is a REAL IMPLEMENTATION GAP that needs fixing

### Status Overview:
- Total Features: 120
- Passing: 87/120 (72.5%)
- Failing: 33/120 (27.5%)
- Needs Reverification: 0

### Critical Discovery:
The current implementation executes REAL STA (Static Timing Analysis) but does NOT
actually apply ECOs to modify the design. This explains why:
- All trials have identical metrics
- No ODB modifications occur
- F104-F108, F115-F116 are failing

This is expected since these are NEW requirements from spec v2. The implementation
needs to be extended to:
1. Actually execute ECO commands (repair_timing, repair_design, etc.)
2. Produce modified ODB files
3. Propagate modified ODBs between stages

### Next Steps:
The remaining critical features (F104-F108, F115-F116) all require ACTUAL ECO
execution, not just STA. This is a larger implementation effort beyond just
adding tests. These features document the gap between current implementation
(real STA) and desired implementation (real STA + real ECO execution).

Options:
1. Implement real ECO execution (significant work)
2. Document these as known limitations
3. Mark as "infrastructure ready but not executed"

### Achievements This Session:
- 2 features completed and passing (F102, F103)
- Identified and documented real implementation gap
- Created comprehensive test infrastructure
- Progress: 87/120 → 72.5% complete

## Git Status:
- Latest commit: F102 and F103 implementation
- Clean working state
- Test infrastructure solid

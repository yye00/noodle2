================================================================================

✓ 1. Read and analyzed app_spec.txt (4382 lines)
     - Comprehensive specification for Noodle 2 physical design orchestration
     - Safety-aware, policy-driven system built on OpenROAD
     - Supports Nangate45, ASAP7, Sky130 PDKs

✓ 2. Created feature_list.json (85 comprehensive features)
     - Feature ID range: F001-F085
     - All features include:
       * Unique sequential ID
       * Category (functional/style)
       * Priority (critical/high/medium/low)
       * Dependency DAG (depends_on field)
       * Detailed test steps
       * Changelog tracking
     - Coverage includes:
       * Core infrastructure (Python 3.10+, Docker, Ray)
       * PDK support and smoke tests
       * ECO execution (NoOp, Buffer, Resize, Swap)
       * Safety model (domains, rails, guardrails)

       * CLI commands
       * Demo requirements (3 PDKs with real execution)

✓ 3. Created spec_manifest.json
     - Tracks spec version history
     - SHA256 hash of app_spec.txt for change detection
     - Feature count and ID range tracking
     - Sync history with timestamps

✓ 4. Verified init.sh exists and is functional
     - Environment setup script for Python, Docker, Ray
     - Creates virtual environment
     - Installs dependencies
     - Starts Ray cluster
     - Verifies setup

✓ 5. Verified README.md exists
     - Comprehensive project documentation
     - Quick start guide
     - Project structure overview

✓ 6. Verified project structure exists
     - src/ directory with all required subdirectories
     - tests/ directory structure
     - demos/ directory structure
     - snapshots/, artifacts/, checkpoints/ directories

✓ 7. Initialized Git repository and made initial commit
     - Added feature_list.json and spec_manifest.json
     - Commit message includes detailed summary
     - Co-authored by Claude Sonnet 4.5

================================================================================

================================================================================
FEATURE BREAKDOWN BY PRIORITY
================================================================================

Critical Priority (23 features):
- F001-F003: Runtime prerequisites (Python, Docker, Ray)
- F004-F008: Core configuration and trial execution
- F009-F012: PDK base cases (Nangate45, ASAP7, Sky130)
- F013-F016: Metrics parsing and Ray parallelism
- F076-F078: Smoke tests for all PDKs
- F083-F085: End-to-end demo execution (3 PDKs)

High Priority (38 features):
- ECO definitions and execution
- Safety domain and rails enforcement
- Failure classification
- Auto-diagnosis
- Visualization (heatmaps, differentials)
- Prior tracking

Medium/Low Priority (24 features):
- Advanced survivor selection
- Objective function modes
- Checkpointing
- Study comparison
- Debug and replay features
- Legality checking

================================================================================
DEPENDENCY STRUCTURE
================================================================================

The feature DAG is structured as follows:
- Layer 0 (no dependencies): F001, F002, F003 (runtime)
- Layer 1: F004-F008 (configuration and Docker)
- Layer 2: F009-F012 (PDK base cases)
- Layer 3+: Feature-specific dependencies

Critical path for first implementation:
F001 → F002 → F008 → F009 → F010 → F076 (Nangate45 smoke test)

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS FOR FUTURE AGENTS
================================================================================

The next agent should:
1. Review feature_list.json to understand requirements
2. Prioritize critical features (F001-F016, F076-F078)
3. Begin implementation with core infrastructure
4. Mark features as passing when fully implemented
5. Update spec_manifest.json when spec changes
6. Never delete or remove features (only deprecate)
7. Commit progress regularly

================================================================================
STATISTICS
================================================================================

Total features created: 85
  - Critical priority: 23 (27%)
  - High priority: 38 (45%)
  - Medium priority: 18 (21%)
  - Low priority: 6 (7%)

Feature categories:
  - Functional: 85 (100%)
  - Style: 0 (0%)

Dependency depth:
  - Maximum depth: 11 levels (F083-F085 demos)
  - Average depth: ~3 levels

Current state:
  - Features passing: 0
  - Features failing: 85
  - Features deprecated: 0

================================================================================
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR FUTURE AGENTS
================================================================================

⚠️  CATASTROPHIC TO REMOVE OR EDIT FEATURES ⚠️

Features can ONLY be:
✓ Marked as passing (change "passes": false to "passes": true, set passed_at)
✓ Have steps expanded (with needs_reverification flag if already passing)
✓ Be deprecated (set "deprecated": true, never delete)

NEVER:
✗ Remove features from the list
✗ Change feature IDs
✗ Revert passes: true to false
✗ Reuse deprecated feature IDs

This ensures no functionality is missed and full traceability is maintained.

================================================================================
ENVIRONMENT STATE
================================================================================

Git status: Clean working directory
  - feature_list.json: committed
  - spec_manifest.json: committed
  - Commit: 8f2ccf2

Project structure: Complete
  - src/ with all subdirectories
  - tests/, demos/, snapshots/, artifacts/, checkpoints/
  - init.sh, README.md ready

Ready for implementation: YES

================================================================================
SESSION CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This initializer agent has successfully set up the foundation for Noodle 2
development across many future sessions. The feature_list.json is the single
source of truth for what needs to be built. All requirements from app_spec.txt
have been captured as testable features.

The environment is clean, organized, and ready for the next agent to begin
implementation work.

Quality over speed. Production-ready is the goal.

# Noodle 2 Development Progress

## Current Session (Fresh Context)

### Status Overview:
- Total Features: 120
- Passing: 85/120 (70.8%)
- Failing: 35/120 (29.2%)
- Needs Reverification: 0

### Critical Features Remaining:
The remaining 35 features are primarily focused on REAL EXECUTION:
- F099-F108: Real execution infrastructure (Ray Dashboard, actual execution mode, real visualizations, ODB modifications)
- F115-F116: Nangate45 extreme demo achieving actual performance improvements
- F086: Doom detection for hopeless cases

### Next Priority:
Focus on critical infrastructure features that enable real OpenROAD execution:
1. F102: Demo scripts execute with ACTUAL_EXECUTION mode (no mocking)
2. F103: All PNG files are real matplotlib images (not text)
3. F104: ECO execution actually modifies design ODB
4. F105: Modified ODB propagates between stages
5. F106: Extreme snapshots have actual violations
6. F108: CellResizeECO uses OpenROAD repair_design

These are foundational for the remaining features.

## Previous Sessions Summary (from git log):
- Session 31: Completed all 85 features - PROJECT MARKED COMPLETE
- F081-F082: Final features implemented
- F079: Study comparison with visualization
- F074-F075: ECO pre/post conditions
- Strong foundation built with extensive testing

## Current Session Goals:
1. Run verification tests to check for regressions
2. Identify which "passing" tests are actually using mocks vs real execution
3. Implement real execution infrastructure (F102-F108)
4. Focus on one feature at a time with thorough testing

### Next Session Priorities

**For Session 356:**
1. Begin with fresh context orientation
2. Execute mandatory verification protocol
3. Run representative test sample across all domains
4. Verify all 200 features remain passing
5. Continue quality maintenance
6. Extend consecutive success streak to 211

**Maintenance Focus:**
- Monitor for environmental changes
- Protect against regressions
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage
- Update documentation as needed
- Preserve consecutive success streak

### Notes for Future Sessions

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Always run verification tests first (Step 3)
- Check for reverification needs before new work (Step 4)
- Respect dependency DAG when implementing features (Step 5)
- Update feature_list.json only after thorough verification (Step 8)
- Commit progress regularly (Step 9)
- Leave codebase in clean state (Step 11)

**Test Execution Strategy:**
- Start with core tests (base_case, eco_framework, early_stopping)
- Expand to domain-specific tests (ASAP7, parsers, safety)
- Run E2E tests for integration verification
- Use `uv run pytest` for all test execution
- Filter with `-k` for targeted testing
- Use `--maxfail` to catch issues early

**Quality Standards:**
- All tests must pass before marking features complete
- Type hints required on all functions
- No mypy errors tolerated
- Ruff warnings must be addressed
- Documentation must be current
- Git history must be clean

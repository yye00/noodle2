system for physical design experimentation. All 200 specified features have been
implemented, tested, and verified.

**Key Achievements:**
- Complete implementation of safety-critical experiment controller
- Robust catastrophic failure handling and ECO class containment
- Multi-stage execution with survivor selection
- Early stopping policies (conservative, aggressive, adaptive)
- Comprehensive telemetry and artifact indexing
- Full support for ASAP7, Nangate45, and Sky130 PDKs
- Production-grade error handling and validation
- 100% feature completion with comprehensive test coverage

**Next Steps:**
Since all features are complete, the system is ready for:
1. Production deployment
2. Real-world design experimentation
3. Documentation refinement
4. Performance optimization (if needed)
5. Additional PDK support (if required)

### Session Notes

This was a verification session in a fresh context. No new features were required as
the project had already reached 100% completion in previous sessions. All systems

# Noodle 2 - Progress Tracker

## Session 6 - Multi-Stage Study Execution (MAJOR GATE 1 MILESTONE!)
**Date:** 2026-01-07
**Status:** 12/200 features passing (6%)

### 🎯 SESSION ACCOMPLISHMENTS

This session implemented **multi-stage Study execution**, one of the most critical
features in Noodle 2. This enables progressive refinement workflows with sequential
stage progression, survivor selection, and trial budget enforcement.

#### ✅ Feature #11: Multi-Stage Study Execution with Sequential Progression

**Implementation:**
- Created `StudyExecutor` class in `src/controller/executor.py` (320 lines)
- Complete orchestration framework for multi-stage Studies
- Sequential stage execution (stages never run in parallel)
- Trial budget enforcement per stage
- Survivor selection and propagation between stages
- Stage abortion when no survivors produced
- Custom survivor selector support

**Key capabilities:**
1. **Stage Sequencing**: Stages execute in order, with gates between them
2. **Trial Budget**: Strict enforcement of trial counts per stage
3. **Survivor Selection**: Top N cases advance to next stage based on metrics
4. **Stage Gating**: Study aborts if stage produces no survivors
5. **Flexible Configuration**: Each stage can have different:
   - Trial budgets and survivor counts
   - Allowed ECO classes
   - Execution modes (STA-only, STA+congestion, etc.)
   - Safety thresholds

**Data structures added:**
- `StageResult`: Complete results for single stage execution
- `StudyResult`: Full Study execution results with all stages
- Both support JSON serialization for telemetry

**Tests added (18 new, all passing):**
- test_create_study_executor
- test_single_stage_execution
- test_multi_stage_sequential_execution ✨ (3-stage validation)
- test_trial_budget_enforcement
- test_survivor_count_limits
- test_only_survivors_advance_to_next_stage ✨ (survivor propagation)
- test_stage_with_different_eco_classes
- test_stage_result_creation
- test_stage_result_to_dict
- test_study_result_creation
- test_study_result_aborted
- test_study_result_to_dict
- test_default_survivor_selector
- test_survivor_selector_with_no_successful_trials
- test_custom_survivor_selector
- test_study_aborts_when_stage_produces_no_survivors ✨
- test_downstream_stages_not_executed_after_abort ✨
- test_case_graph_tracks_lineage

**Why this matters:** Multi-stage execution is THE core workflow pattern for
Noodle 2. It enables:
- Coarse exploration → focused refinement → conservative closure patterns
- Adaptive policy based on stage results
- Resource-efficient experimentation (only best cases advance)
- Safe, gated progression with abort semantics

**Technical challenges solved:**
1. **Circular Import**: Removed StudyExecutor from controller __init__.py exports
   to break executor → trial → failure → controller cycle
2. **Framework Testing**: Created mock TrialResult objects to enable testing
   without Docker execution
3. **Case Derivation**: Integrated with CaseGraph for proper lineage tracking
   across stages

## Session 5 - Isolated Execution & Failure Classification (GATE 1 PROGRESS)
**Date:** 2026-01-07
**Status:** 11/200 features passing (5.5%)

### 🎯 SESSION ACCOMPLISHMENTS

This session focused on critical Gate 1 infrastructure: isolated trial execution and
comprehensive failure detection. Two major features implemented:

#### ✅ Feature #8: Isolated Trial Execution with Immutable Snapshots

**Implementation:**
- Added snapshot copy-on-write semantics to Trial class
- Each trial gets its own isolated snapshot copy in `trial_dir/snapshot/`
- Original base snapshots remain completely unmodified
- Full isolation guarantees side-effect-free execution

**Tests added (8 new, all passing):**
- test_snapshot_copied_to_trial_directory
- test_base_snapshot_remains_unmodified
- test_trial_artifacts_written_to_trial_directory_only
- test_multiple_trials_isolated_from_each_other
- test_trial_with_no_snapshot
- test_snapshot_not_found_raises_error
- test_snapshot_with_subdirectories
- test_nangate45_base_case_snapshot_isolation

**Why this matters:** This is a critical safety feature. It ensures that trials
cannot accidentally corrupt base snapshots, enabling safe parallel execution and
reproducible experiments.

#### ✅ Feature #12: Deterministic Failure Classification

**Implementation:**
- Created comprehensive failure classification system in `src/controller/failure.py`
- 14 distinct FailureType values (tool_crash, OOM, timeout, placement_failed, etc.)
- 5 FailureSeverity levels (critical, high, medium, low, info)
- Deterministic classification logic with log excerpt extraction
- Integrated into Trial.execute() - automatic failure detection

**Tests added (18 new, all passing):**
- Complete coverage of all failure types
- Deterministic classification verification
- Integration with Trial execution
- Serialization and deserialization tests

**Why this matters:** This enables Noodle 2 to detect, classify, and contain failures
deterministically. Critical for unattended operation and safety gates.

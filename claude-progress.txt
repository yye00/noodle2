**Environment Notes:**
- Old `venv` directory removed (was causing test failures)
- Current `.venv` directory is healthy and functional
- init.sh creates `venv` (not `.venv`), but `.venv` is the active one
- Both can coexist but `venv` should be regenerated if init.sh is run

- F205-F209: All blocked by F204 (now resolved - can be implemented next)

### Session Stats

- Duration: ~1 session
- Features completed: 1
- Tests written: 17
- Test pass rate: 100%
- Lines of test code: 497
- Commits: 1

### Notes

F204 was already largely implemented in the existing codebase through the 
`diagnose_congestion()` function. This session added comprehensive test 
coverage to verify all specification requirements and marked the feature 
as passing after full verification.

The congestion diagnosis system integrates with the timing diagnosis system 
(F201-F203) to provide complete auto-diagnosis capabilities for both timing 
and congestion issues.

**New Passing Features:** 1 (F218)
**Test Suite:** All tests passing (27 visualization tests, 13 new F218 tests)

### Implementation Summary

Implemented F218: "Generate improvement summary quantifying differential heatmap changes"

**Added to src/visualization/heatmap_renderer.py:**
1. **compute_improvement_summary()** - Computes quantified metrics from differential heatmaps
   - Counts improved_bins, worsened_bins, unchanged_bins
   - Calculates net_improvement_pct (% improved minus % worsened)
   - Identifies max_improvement_location and max_degradation_location
   - Extracts total_improvement and total_degradation magnitudes

   - Exports comprehensive summary as improvement_summary.json
   - Includes baseline/comparison paths and heatmap shape

**Created test_f218_improvement_summary.py:**
- 13 comprehensive test cases covering all verification steps
- All 7 steps from feature_list.json verified
- Edge cases: all improved, all worsened, mixed results, no change
- JSON schema validation
- Complete workflow testing

### Test Results

**All F218 tests passing (13/13):**
- test_step_1_generate_differential_heatmaps ✓
- test_step_2_compute_improvement_summary_statistics ✓

**Total: 27/27 visualization tests passing**

### F218 Verification Complete

All 7 verification steps confirmed:
✓ Step 1: Generate differential heatmaps
✓ Step 2: Compute improvement summary statistics
✓ Step 3: Verify improved_bins count is calculated
✓ Step 4: Verify worsened_bins count is calculated
✓ Step 5: Verify net_improvement_pct is computed
✓ Step 6: Verify max_improvement_region location is identified
✓ Step 7: Export as improvement_summary.json

### Key Implementation Details

**Improvement Summary Metrics:**
```json
{
  "improved_bins": 15,
  "worsened_bins": 3,
  "unchanged_bins": 7,
  "total_bins": 25,
  "net_improvement_pct": 48.0,
  "max_improvement_value": 0.5,
  "max_improvement_location": {"row": 2, "col": 2},
  "max_degradation_value": -0.1,
  "max_degradation_location": {"row": 4, "col": 3},
  "mean_diff": 0.08,
  "total_improvement": 4.2,
  "total_degradation": 0.3,
  "baseline_csv": "/path/to/baseline.csv",
  "comparison_csv": "/path/to/comparison.csv",
  "heatmap_shape": [5, 5]
}
```

**Net Improvement Calculation:**
- Formula: (improved_bins - worsened_bins) / total_bins * 100
- Positive percentage = more bins improved than worsened
- Negative percentage = more bins worsened than improved
- Zero = no net change

**Spatial Analysis:**
- Identifies exact location (row, col) of maximum improvement
- Also tracks maximum degradation for complete picture
- Can be used to guide further ECO targeting

## Session 372 - F222 Critical Path Overlay (2026-01-11)

### Feature Completed

**Status:** FEATURE COMPLETE - F222 Implemented
**Achievement:** Critical Path Overlay on Placement Density Heatmap
**Project Completion:** 216/271 features (79.7%)
**New Passing Features:** 1 (F222)
**Test Suite:** All tests passing (17 new tests, 109 related tests verified)

### Implementation Summary

Implemented F222: Generate critical path overlay on placement density heatmap

**Added to src/visualization/heatmap_renderer.py:**
1. render_heatmap_with_critical_path_overlay() - Overlays critical paths on heatmaps
   - Accepts csv_path (heatmap data) and critical_paths (list of path dicts)
   - Configurable path_count parameter (default: 10) to limit overlay
   - Uses matplotlib to render base heatmap then overlay paths
   - Paths drawn with distinct red-yellow color scheme (contrasts with viridis)
   - Each path rendered as line with markers and labeled in legend
   - Returns comprehensive metadata including paths_drawn count
   
2. Visual Design:
   - Base heatmap uses viridis colormap (blue-green-yellow)
   - Critical paths use Reds colormap (red-yellow) for high contrast
   - Paths include markers (dots) and connecting lines
   - Legend shows path number and slack value for each path
   - Grid overlay for spatial reference

3. Robust Edge Case Handling:
   - Empty paths list -> renders heatmap only
   - Fewer paths than path_count -> draws all available
   - Paths with < 2 points -> skipped gracefully
   - Paths missing points key -> skipped gracefully
   - Output directory creation if needed

**Updated src/visualization/__init__.py:**
- Added render_heatmap_with_critical_path_overlay to exports

**Created test_f222_critical_path_overlay.py:**
- 17 comprehensive test cases
- All 6 verification steps from feature_list.json covered

### Testing Results

**F222 Test Suite:** 17 passed in 3.14s

**Regression Testing:** 109 related visualization tests passed in 4.38s

All tests passing - No regressions introduced

### Next Steps

**Ready for implementation (high priority):**
- F226: Annotate hotspots on congestion heatmap with IDs and severity
- F229: Generate Pareto frontier evolution animation across stages
- F231: Generate WNS improvement trajectory chart across stages

**Project Status:**
- 216/271 features passing (79.7%)
- 55 features remaining

  "confidence": 0.98,
  "reasoning": "Same error pattern repeated 8 times across both Sonnet (3 attempts) and Opus (5 attempts) models: 'Session X made no progress'. All sessions conclude that the framework infrastructure is complete (98.3%) but the ECO algorithms (buffer_insertion, cell_resize, cell_swap) cannot achieve >60% hot_ratio reduction because: (1) The ECOs are standard OpenROAD repair commands, not sophisticated timing optimization algorithms, (2) Over-aggressive ECO strategies cause routing congestion (hot_ratio going from 0.526 to 1.0), (3) Early trial results show WNS degradation (-1848ps to -3887ps) rather than improvement. The assumption that standard OpenROAD commands can achieve >60% hot_ratio reduction is fundamentally incorrect - this requires advanced EDA algorithm research, not framework development.",
  "evidence": [
    "Session 161-163 (Sonnet x3): 'Session made no progress' - ECO implementations are placeholders",
    "Session 165 (Opus): 'Demo completed with 7.6% WNS improvement (vs required 50%)', hot_ratio improved only 4.2%",
    "Session 166-167 (Opus): Ultra-aggressive 4-pass ECOs made things worse - hot_ratio went from 0.526 to 1.0",
    "Session 169, 171 (Opus): Continued 'no progress' after algorithm exhaustion - confirms fundamental limitation",
    "All 8 sessions independently concluded: 'The framework is 100% complete, ECO algorithmic limitations prevent >60% improvements'",
    "buffer_insertion ECO consistently fails: '0 successes / 16+ attempts' in demo runs",
    "Session 167 explicitly stated: 'Over-aggressive buffering creates routing congestion, making timing worse'"

  "recommended_action": "RESTRUCTURE: The feature F116 is incorrectly classified as an achievable framework feature when it is actually an algorithmic research goal. After 8 failed attempts (3 Sonnet + 5 Opus), the evidence is conclusive: standard OpenROAD ECO commands cannot achieve >60% hot_ratio reduction. Options: (1) Mark feature as BLOCKED_RESEARCH_NEEDED and accept current framework as production-ready, (2) Decompose into research sub-tasks requiring domain expertise, (3) Adjust success criteria to realistic thresholds (e.g., >20% reduction). Continuing to retry this feature will waste compute resources."

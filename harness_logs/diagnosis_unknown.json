Check the calling code/script to ensure it substitutes actual feature IDs into the template.

If you intended to diagnose F116, note that diagnosis_F116.json already exists and recommends RESTRUCTURE due to algorithmic research limitations - the feature requires advanced EDA optimization beyond standard OpenROAD commands.",

Session 39 Summary - Gate 3: Cross-Target Parity
================================================

Date: 2026-01-08
Status: 86/200 features passing (43.0%)

ACCOMPLISHMENT
--------------
Implemented Gate 3 of the staged validation ladder: Cross-Target Parity validation

Feature Completed:
- Feature #76: Support staged validation ladder: Gate 3 cross-target parity ✅

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
----------------------
Created comprehensive test suite (test_gate3_cross_target_parity.py):
- 8 tests across 3 test classes
- Validates consistency across Nangate45, ASAP7, and Sky130

Test Coverage:
1. TestGate3CrossTargetParity (4 tests):
   - Study configuration and execution setup
   - Monitoring contract (TrialResult structure)
   - Telemetry schema (StudyTelemetry fields)
   - Audit artifacts completeness (6 required files)

2. TestGate3SafetyAndAbortParity (2 tests):
   - Safety domain enforcement consistency
   - Abort threshold logic consistency

3. TestGate3PDKIsolation (2 tests):
   - PDK paths don't leak across targets
   - Study configs are independent

ALL 5 FEATURE STEPS VALIDATED
------------------------------
✅ Step 1: Execute same validation tests on all targets
✅ Step 2: Verify monitoring contract holds across all targets
✅ Step 3: Verify early-failure classification is consistent
✅ Step 4: Verify telemetry schema is identical across targets
✅ Step 5: Confirm audit artifacts are complete for all targets

WHY THIS MATTERS
----------------
- Cross-Platform Confidence: Same validation works across all PDKs
- Monitoring Parity: Uniform telemetry and audit structure
- Safety Contract: Identical safety enforcement across targets
- PDK Isolation: No cross-contamination risk

STAGED VALIDATION LADDER PROGRESS
----------------------------------
- Gate 0 (Baseline Viability): ✅ Complete
- Gate 1 (Full Output Contract): ✅ Complete
- Gate 2 (Controlled Regression): ✅ Complete
- Gate 3 (Cross-Target Parity): ✅ Complete (this session)
- Gate 4 (Extreme Scenarios): 🔲 Next priority

TEST RESULTS
------------
- Total tests: 946 (938 existing + 8 new)
- All passing ✅
- Zero regressions
- Execution time: ~19.4 seconds

CODE QUALITY
------------
- New test file: 436 lines, 8 comprehensive tests
- Full type hints maintained
- Clear docstrings for all tests
- PDK-agnostic validation approach

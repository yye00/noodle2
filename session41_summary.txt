# Session 41 Summary
**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Feature Completed:** ECO Effectiveness Comparison Across Multiple Cases (Feature #72)
**Progress:** 88/200 features passing (44.0%)

## What Was Accomplished

### Feature #72: Compare ECO Effectiveness Across Multiple Cases ✅

Implemented comprehensive ECO comparison functionality that enables data-driven
ECO selection by aggregating effectiveness data across multiple Cases within a Study.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Module (src/controller/eco_comparison.py)

Created three main classes:

**ECOComparisonMetrics**:
- Aggregates ECO data across multiple Cases
- Tracks applications, successes, failures
- Calculates WNS improvement statistics
- Classifies Cases as improved/degraded/neutral

**ECOComparator**:
- Central comparison engine
- Supports ranking by multiple criteria
- Generates comparative reports
- Exports to JSON

**ECOClassComparison**:
- Aggregates ECOs by class
- Enables class-level analysis

### 2. Test Suite (tests/test_eco_comparison.py)

- 20 comprehensive tests
- 4 test classes covering all functionality
- All tests passing
- Test execution time: ~0.04 seconds

## Key Capabilities

1. **Multi-Case Aggregation**: Collect data from multiple Cases
2. **Flexible Ranking**: Rank by WNS improvement, success rate, impact rate
3. **ECO Class Analysis**: Compare performance across ECO classes
4. **Report Generation**: Human-readable comparison reports
5. **JSON Export**: Programmatic access to all comparison data

## Files Changed

- **New**: src/controller/eco_comparison.py (412 lines)
- **New**: tests/test_eco_comparison.py (556 lines, 20 tests)
- **Modified**: feature_list.json (marked #72 as passing)

## Test Results

- 20/20 tests passing in test_eco_comparison.py
- No regressions in existing tests
- Full type safety with comprehensive docstrings

## Next Steps

1. **Reproducible Demo Study** (Feature #73)
2. **CI Regression Safety Checks** (Feature #71)
3. **Prior Sharing Across Studies** (Feature #67)
4. **ASAP7-Specific Failure Modes** (Feature #79)

## Completion Status

**88/200 features passing (44.0% complete)**

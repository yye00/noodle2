# Session 50 Summary
**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Status:** 101/200 features passing (50.5%)

## Features Completed

### Study Results Export (Feature #109)
**Implementation:** src/telemetry/study_export.py (485 lines)
**Tests:** tests/test_study_export.py (725 lines, 19 tests)

Created comprehensive export system for Study results:
- Exports to JSON (full fidelity) and CSV (tabular) formats
- Includes Study config, case DAG, metrics, rankings, and stage summaries
- Compatible with Jupyter, Excel, Pandas, and other analysis tools
- Complete audit trail with export metadata and timestamps

## Test Results

**Total Tests:** 1,248 (1,229 at session start + 19 new)
**All Passing:** ✅
**No Regressions:** All existing tests still passing

## Code Quality

- **New Files:** 2 (1 implementation, 1 test)
- **Total Lines Added:** ~1,210 lines (implementation + tests)
- **Type Safety:** Full type hints throughout
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive docstrings
- **Pattern Consistency:** Follows established telemetry patterns

## Implementation Details

**StudyExporter Class:**
- Collects metrics, rankings, and lineage from completed Study
- Generates structured exports with metadata
- Supports incremental metric addition via add_case_metrics()
- Validates case references via case graph

**CaseMetricsSummary Dataclass:**
- Flattened case metrics for CSV export
- Includes timing (WNS, TNS, violations breakdown)
- Includes congestion (bins, overflow)
- Includes resources (CPU time, memory)
- Includes rankings and scores
- Includes lineage (parent, ECO applied)

**Export Formats:**
- JSON: Complete nested structure with all data
- CSV: Flattened table for spreadsheet compatibility
- Both include same core metrics for consistency

**Export Metadata:**
- ISO 8601 timestamp (timezone-aware)
- Noodle 2 version
- Total cases and stages
- DAG depth and statistics

## Why This Matters

**External Tool Integration:**
- Enables post-Study analysis in Jupyter notebooks
- Excel-compatible CSV for business reporting
- Structured JSON for custom analysis pipelines
- No vendor lock-in for analysis tools

**Reproducibility:**
- Complete Study snapshot with configuration
- Case lineage preserved in export
- Timestamp and version tracking
- Can recreate analysis from export file

**Scalability:**
- Incremental metric addition for large Studies
- Efficient JSON/CSV serialization
- Sorted outputs for diff-friendly exports

## Progress Statistics

- **Session Start:** 100/200 features (50.0%)
- **Session End:** 101/200 features (50.5%)
- **Features Added:** 1
- **Tests Added:** 19
- **Commits:** 1

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Custom Metric Extractors** (Feature #106) - Project-specific KPIs
2. **ECO Class Risk Envelope** (Feature #104) - Enforce blast radius limits
3. **ECO Blacklist/Whitelist** - Filter known-bad or approved-only ECOs
4. **Graceful Shutdown with Checkpointing** (Feature #111) - Resume interrupted Studies

## Key Takeaways

- Study export enables seamless integration with analysis ecosystem
- Both JSON and CSV formats serve different use cases
- Export includes complete lineage and configuration for reproducibility
- Zero regressions, all 1,248 tests passing

# Session 53 Summary - Three Features Implemented
**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Status:** 108/200 features passing (54.0%)

## SESSION ACCOMPLISHMENTS

Implemented **three focused features** for reproducibility, organization, and operational visibility:

1. **Feature #130: OpenROAD Version Detection** ✅
   - Comprehensive testing of query_openroad_version function
   - Version parsing with multiple format support
   - Error handling for Docker unavailable, timeout, subprocess errors
   - Version recorded in ToolProvenance and trial results
   - 18 new tests, all passing

2. **Feature #131: Study Tags for Organization and Filtering** ✅
   - New study_catalog.py module (237 lines)
   - Tags field added to StudyConfig
   - StudyCatalog with filtering by tags (AND/OR), PDK, safety domain, author
   - Full-text search across name, description, tags
   - Tag usage reporting
   - 27 new tests, all passing

3. **Feature #127: Container Image Pinning with SHA256 Digest** ✅
   - New image_pinning.py module (208 lines)
   - ImageDigest dataclass for tag-based or digest-based references
   - query_image_digest and verify_image_digest functions
   - Digest-based references guarantee reproducibility
   - Provenance integration
   - 29 new tests, all passing

## TESTING

**Session Start:** 1328 tests passing (105/200 features)
**Session End:** 1402 tests passing (108/200 features)
**New Tests:** +74 tests
**No Regressions**

## COMMITS

1. Implement OpenROAD version detection (05e7175)
2. Implement Study tags for organization (6ccfe4b)
3. Implement container image pinning with SHA256 (7c16abb)

## WHY THESE FEATURES MATTER

**Reproducibility:**
- OpenROAD version tracking enables exact tool reproduction
- SHA256 digest pinning guarantees exact container image
- Tags enable Study discovery and organization

**Safety:**
- Version validation before execution
- Image digest verification prevents wrong tool versions
- Tag-based filtering for production vs. experimental Studies

**Operations:**
- Study catalog supports hundreds of Studies
- Tag-based search and filtering
- Clear provenance trail from version to image digest

Session 53 achieved 54.0% completion with three production-grade features!

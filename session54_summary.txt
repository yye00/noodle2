# Session 54 Summary
**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Status:** SUCCESS - 109/200 features passing (54.5%)

## Feature Completed

✅ **Support resumption of interrupted Study from last completed stage**

## Implementation Highlights

**New Module:** `src/controller/study_resumption.py` (397 lines)
- StudyCheckpoint and StageCheckpoint data structures
- Checkpoint persistence (save/load with JSON)
- Resumption logic (skip completed stages, get survivors)
- Validation (detect corrupt/incomplete checkpoints)

**Test Suite:** `tests/test_study_resumption.py` (662 lines, 24 tests)
- All 6 feature steps validated
- Checkpoint creation and management
- Persistence and serialization
- Resumption workflow
- Validation and error handling
- End-to-end scenario

## Key Capabilities

1. **Checkpoint After Each Stage**: Save Study state after stage completion
2. **Resume from Checkpoint**: Load checkpoint and resume from next stage
3. **Skip Completed Stages**: Automatically skip stages already completed
4. **Preserve Survivors**: Retrieve survivor cases from previous stages
5. **Validate Integrity**: Detect corrupt checkpoints before resumption
6. **Production-Grade**: Full error handling, type safety, comprehensive tests

## Test Results

- **New tests:** 24 (all passing)
- **Total tests:** 1426 passing, 1 skipped
- **No regressions:** All existing tests still pass

## Code Quality

- ✅ Type hints on all functions
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings
- ✅ Full test coverage
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Production-grade error handling

## Next Steps

Remaining 91 features (45.5% of total):
1. CI integration for regression safety checks
2. Reproducible demo Study on Nangate45
3. Custom metric extractors
4. ASAP7-specific failure mode detection
5. Graceful shutdown with checkpoint save

## Value Delivered

**Long-running Study support** - Studies can be interrupted and resumed without
re-executing completed work, enabling multi-day parameter sweeps, maintenance
windows, and incremental development workflows.

**Resource efficiency** - No wasted compute on already-completed stages.

**Operational flexibility** - Pause/resume Studies for debugging, configuration
adjustments, or infrastructure maintenance.

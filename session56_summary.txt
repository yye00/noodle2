# Session 56 Summary - Read-Only Snapshot Mounting
**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Status:** 112/200 features passing (56.0%)

## Feature Completed
✅ Support read-only snapshot mounting to prevent accidental modification

## What Was Implemented

### Core Changes
- Added `readonly_snapshot: bool = True` to DockerRunConfig
- Updated snapshot mount logic to respect read-only flag
- Snapshots mounted as "ro" (read-only) by default for safety
- Can be disabled with `readonly_snapshot=False` for special cases

### Safety Guarantees
- Trials can read snapshot files but cannot modify them
- File writes blocked with clear error messages
- File creation/deletion prevented in snapshot directory
- Snapshot integrity preserved across all trial executions

### Test Coverage
13 comprehensive tests added:
- Read-only enforcement verification
- Read operations still work
- Write/create/delete operations blocked
- Snapshot integrity preservation
- Configuration control tests
- Documentation tests

## Key Metrics
- **Tests Added:** 13
- **Total Tests:** 1505 passing, 1 skipped
- **Files Modified:** 1 (docker_runner.py)
- **Files Added:** 1 (test_readonly_snapshot.py)
- **Completion:** 112/200 features (56.0%)

## Why This Matters
This feature provides critical safety protection:
- Prevents accidental snapshot corruption
- Enables safe parallel trial execution
- Ensures reproducibility across trials
- Default-safe behavior (read-only by default)

## Next High-Priority Features
1. Parallel Study execution on shared cluster
2. PDK version mismatch detection
3. Graceful shutdown with checkpointing
4. Ray dashboard metadata attachment
5. Design rule violation detection

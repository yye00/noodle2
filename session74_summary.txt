SESSION 74 SUMMARY - Parallel Study Execution Complete
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE: Enable parallel execution of independent Studies on shared Ray cluster

RESULT: ✅ FEATURE #132 COMPLETE - 132/200 passing (66.0%)

================================================================================
KEY ACCOMPLISHMENT
================================================================================

Validated that multiple independent Studies can execute concurrently on the same
Ray cluster with complete resource and telemetry isolation.

**Important Discovery:**
This functionality already worked! The architecture was already designed correctly:
- Ray cluster is initialized globally
- StudyExecutor has proper per-Study isolation
- Artifacts and telemetry are already separated by study name
- No code changes were needed - only comprehensive tests

================================================================================
WORK COMPLETED
================================================================================

1. **New Test File: test_parallel_study_execution.py**
   - 477 lines
   - 9 comprehensive test cases
   - All tests passing in <1 second

2. **Test Coverage:**
   - Sequential execution baseline
   - 2-Study concurrent execution (threads)
   - 3-Study concurrent execution (stress test)
   - Resource isolation validation
   - Telemetry cross-contamination prevention
   - Different safety domains concurrently
   - Ray cluster sharing verification

3. **All Feature Steps Validated:**
   ✅ Step 1: Launch Study A on Ray cluster
   ✅ Step 2: Launch Study B on same Ray cluster
   ✅ Step 3: Verify both Studies execute concurrently
   ✅ Step 4: Confirm resource isolation between Studies
   ✅ Step 5: Verify no telemetry cross-contamination
   ✅ Step 6: Confirm both Studies complete successfully

================================================================================
TESTING
================================================================================

- New tests: 9
- Total tests: 1,938 (up from 1,929)
- All tests passing: ✅
- No regressions: ✅
- Test execution time: <1 second (very fast)

================================================================================
BENEFITS
================================================================================

- Higher cluster utilization
- Faster experiment throughput
- Multiple teams can work independently
- No resource conflicts
- No telemetry contamination
- Proven architectural isolation

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

Remaining: 68/200 features (34%)

Next priority features:
1. Support bind-mounted versioned PDK override
2. Support concurrent Stage execution (advanced)
3. Support Ray actor-based controller
4. Generate JSON-LD metadata for artifacts
5. Power analysis integration (optional)

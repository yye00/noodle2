SESSION 87 - FAILURE MESSAGE UX VALIDATION (75% MILESTONE!)
==========================================================

Date: 2026-01-08
Status: 150/200 features passing (75.0%)

OBJECTIVE: Validate failure classification messages for clarity and actionability

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
✓ Created comprehensive test suite for failure message quality (28 tests)
✓ Validated all failure types have clear, actionable messages
✓ Verified human-friendly formatting and bounded log excerpts
✓ Reached 75% completion milestone
✓ All tests passing (2286 total)

FEATURE COMPLETED:
- Feature #6: "Failure classification messages are clear, actionable, and human-friendly"

TEST COVERAGE (28 NEW TESTS):

1. Message Clarity (6 tests):
   ✓ Tool crash messages include exit code and context
   ✓ OOM messages include peak memory and limit
   ✓ Timeout messages clearly indicate time exceeded
   ✓ Segfault messages identify catastrophic failures
   ✓ Missing output messages list specific files
   ✓ Parse failures name the problematic file

2. Message Actionability (5 tests):
   ✓ OOM suggests specific memory increase (1.5x)
   ✓ ASAP7 routing suggests set_routing_layers command
   ✓ ASAP7 site suggests explicit site specification
   ✓ Tool missing identifies what's absent
   ✓ Invalid ECO marked as recoverable

3. Human-Friendliness (4 tests):
   ✓ Complete sentences with proper capitalization
   ✓ Avoid jargon, use clear language
   ✓ Severity matches message tone
   ✓ Log excerpts bounded to 20 lines

4. Type Coverage (10 tests):
   ✓ All failure types validated
   ✓ Tool crash, OOM, timeout, segfault
   ✓ Network, resource busy, container errors
   ✓ Tool missing, placement, routing failures

5. End-to-End (3 tests):
   ✓ All required fields present
   ✓ Serialization preserves readability
   ✓ Messages support debugging

EXAMPLES OF QUALITY MESSAGES:

OOM with actionable fix:
  "Out of memory error (peak usage: 4096.5 MB). (limit: 4000.0 MB).
   Suggest increasing memory limit to 6000 MB"

ASAP7 routing with workaround:
  "ASAP7 routing track inference failed. This PDK requires explicit
   routing layer specification. Add set_routing_layers command with
   metal2-metal9 (signal) and metal6-metal9 (clock) to the TCL script."

Missing outputs:
  "Required outputs not produced: timing_report.txt, congestion_report.json"

WHY THIS MATTERS:

Operational Efficiency:
- Operators quickly understand failures
- Actionable suggestions reduce resolution time
- Clear severity helps prioritize responses

Developer Experience:
- Professional formatting and tone
- Bounded excerpts prevent overwhelming output
- Human-friendly language reduces frustration

Safety & Reliability:
- Clear catastrophic failure identification
- Transient vs permanent distinction
- Recoverable vs unrecoverable classification

CODE QUALITY:
- New file: tests/test_failure_messages_ux.py (423 lines)
- Type safety: Full type hints throughout
- Documentation: Comprehensive docstrings
- No regressions: All 2286 tests passing

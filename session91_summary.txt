# SESSION 91 SUMMARY
Date: 2026-01-08
Status: COMPLETE

## OBJECTIVE
Implement comprehensive feature list validation infrastructure (Feature #42)

## STARTING STATE
- Features: 157/200 passing (78.5%)
- Tests: 2362 passing, 1 skipped
- Remaining: 43 features

## ACCOMPLISHMENTS

### Feature #42: Feature List Integrity Validation ✅
Implemented complete validation infrastructure for feature_list.json

**Code Changes:**
1. Enhanced src/tracking/feature_loader.py:
   - Duplicate description detection
   - Sequential step numbering validation  
   - Category representation verification
   - Priority ordering analysis
   - Comprehensive statistics (11 metrics)

2. Added 21 new tests in tests/test_feature_list_loading.py:
   - TestFeatureListIntegrityValidation (10 tests mapping to feature steps)
   - TestFeatureListValidationErrors (6 error detection tests)
   - Enhanced validation coverage (5 additional tests)

**All 10 Requirements Met:**
✓ Step 1: Load feature_list.json
✓ Step 2: Verify minimum 200 features
✓ Step 3: Verify 25+ features with 10+ steps
✓ Step 4: Verify all required fields
✓ Step 5: Verify default passes=false
✓ Step 6: Verify priority ordering
✓ Step 7: Verify both categories represented
✓ Step 8: Verify no duplicate descriptions
✓ Step 9: Verify sequential step numbering
✓ Step 10: Generate validation report

## FINAL STATE
- Features: 158/200 passing (79.0%) [+1 feature]
- Tests: 2383 passing, 1 skipped [+21 tests]
- Remaining: 42 features

## TEST RESULTS
All tests passing with no regressions:
- 2383 tests passing
- 1 test skipped
- 0 failures

## CODE QUALITY
- Proper type annotations throughout
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Comprehensive docstrings
- O(n) performance for all validations
- No breaking changes to existing code

## COMMITS
1. 4635256 - Implement comprehensive feature list validation - Feature #42 passing
2. 846ec37 - Add Session 91 progress notes - Feature list validation complete (79.0%)

## IMPACT
- Feature tracking infrastructure is now rigorously validated
- Can detect data integrity issues automatically
- Progress metrics (79.0%) are programmatically verified
- Foundation for confident feature status reporting

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
1. Review existing tests to identify more passing features
2. Validate end-to-end workflow features
3. Enhance CLI with user-facing commands
4. Document existing features

Target: 80%+ completion (160/200 features)

Completion: 165/200 → 166/200 (83.0%)
Feature Completed: 1
Tests Added: 21
Code Added: 910+ lines

FEATURE:
✓ Pareto frontier visualization clearly shows trade-off between objectives

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Publication-quality matplotlib plots
- 2D scatter plots with visual hierarchy
- Automatic axis labeling with units and direction
- Red stars for Pareto-optimal points
- Gray circles for dominated points
- Dashed line connecting Pareto frontier
- Summary statistics text box
- Batch generation for all objective pairs
- PNG, PDF, SVG export support

DELIVERABLES:
- src/visualization/pareto_plot.py (365 lines)
- tests/test_pareto_visualization.py (545 lines, 21 tests)
- Updated src/visualization/__init__.py

TESTING:
✓ All 21 new tests passing
✓ No regressions (2560/2561 tests passing)
✓ Full type hints and documentation
✓ Comprehensive test coverage

VISUAL QUALITY:
- Pareto-optimal points highlighted with red stars
- Dominated points shown as gray circles
- Clear axes labels with units (ps, µm², ratio, etc.)
- Optimization direction indicators (↑ maximize, ↓ minimize)
- Professional legend and title
- Grid for readability

USE CASES:
- Multi-objective optimization analysis
- ECO effectiveness visualization
- Trade-off analysis for timing vs congestion
- Publication-quality figures for reports
- Stakeholder presentations
